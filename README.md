To test the data there is a button in the page to change the initial data with the format array of objects that is the same format as first.The second option to change the initial data there is a filed named DummyTasks.js which you can edit this file but after you editing this file you need to clear the localstorage and refresh the page because i use zustand for state management to save all the state so that i would not lose state after refresh or after browser is closed.<br/><br/>
