# React + Vite Task Management

To open the project locally first you need to load the packages by using "yarn" or "npm install" after loading all package you can start the development server by using "yarn start" or "npm start"

To test the data there is a button in the page to change the initial data with the format array of objects that is the same format as first.The second option to change the initial data there is a folder DummyTasks.js you can edit this folder but after you editing this folder you need to clear the localstorage because i use zustand for state management i save all the state by using zustand so that i would not lose state after refresh or after browser is closed.

Actions that you can take
-You can change the status of task with drag and drop action
-You can delete the task
-You can filter the tasks by assignees
-You can create a task 
-You can change the initial data
